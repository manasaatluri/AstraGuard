WIRING (BCM numbering):

Raspberry Pi GPIO pins (BCM):

1) PIR Sensor (HC-SR501):
   - VCC -> 5V (pin 2 or 4) OR 3.3V (depending on PIR module)
   - GND -> GND (pin 6)
   - OUT -> GPIO17 (BCM 17, physical pin 11)

2) Buzzer (active buzzer) via transistor:
   - Buzzer + -> 5V or 3.3V (depending on buzzer)
   - Buzzer - -> Collector of NPN transistor (e.g., 2N2222)
   - Emitter of transistor -> GND
   - Base of transistor -> GPIO27 (BCM 27, physical pin 13) via 1k resistor
   - Add diode across buzzer if driving inductive loads; use common ground.

3) Pi Camera:
   - Connect camera ribbon to CSI connector or use USB webcam to USB port.

4) Power:
   - Use a regulated 5V 2.5A supply for Pi 3/4; for field deploy, use a power bank or solar + charge controller.

Safety:
 - Use level shifting if a peripheral needs different voltage.
 - Use a transistor to drive buzzer to avoid drawing GPIO current.

Optional:
 - Add IR illuminator for night vision.
 - Enclose electronics in waterproof enclosure with camera window.
